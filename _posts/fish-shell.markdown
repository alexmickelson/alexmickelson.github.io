# Fish Shell

### a command line shell for the 90s!

> tl;dr - sudo apt install fish; fish; fish_config

The Fish shell looks like bash but has a couple nice features.

* auto complete - fish will give recomended auto completion
* try to cd /etc and look around your directories, use tab and arrow keys
