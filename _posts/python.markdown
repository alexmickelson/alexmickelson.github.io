# Python

You should always use python3, as python2 is being depricated in [january 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/). 

Pythons name originates because Guido van Rossum (python's creator) was reading the script of Monty Python's Flying Circus when he began implementing python. [source](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/general.html#why-is-it-called-python)

#### Python peps

peps are the official refference for documentation, style and all things python. I will try to reference peps when I can. 

#### Cheese shop

Pip is the package manager for python. You can view (and submit) pip packages on [pypi.org](pypi.org). pipy.org is refered to as the cheese shop after the [monty python sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz1JWzyvv8A). Why name your package manager's website after that sketch, I haven't found a [definitive answer](https://wiki.python.org/moin/CheeseShop).

When using pip use python3 -m pip install <packageName> so that you don't have to deal with environment misalignments (did you install/upgrade the package in the global space? the user space? the directory/package space?)

#### Type checking 

Suprisingly, you can put type checking in an interpreted language. Check out https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html for a cheat sheet.

#### Generate documentation

Sphinx
