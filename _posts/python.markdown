# Python

You should always use python3, as python2 is being depricated in (january 2020)[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/].

#### Python peps

peps are the official refference for documentation, style and all things python. I will try to reference peps when I can. 

#### Type checking 

Suprisingly, you can put type checking in an interpreted language. Check out https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cheat_sheet_py3.html for a cheat sheet.
